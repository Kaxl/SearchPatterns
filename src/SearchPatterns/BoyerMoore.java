/**
 * Class to implement Boyer-Moore algorithm.
 * <p/>
 * The algorithm, like KMP algorithm, makes a pre-processing of the pattern before he searches the pattern in the
 * text that we gave him.
 * At the beginning, two arrays have to be filled, these arrays are going to be used to perform the gaps in the text.
 * The particularity of this algorithm is that he searches the pattern from the last position of the pattern, the last
 * character of it. Using this way, the gaps are a lot more effective and so the algorithm.
 * <p/>
 * For the pattern "ANPANMAN" the two arrays are the following :
 * <p/>
 * Array1 = charTable =
 * +----------------------------------+
 * | letter || A | N | P | M | others |
 * +----------------------------------+
 * |   gap  || 1 | 0 | 5 | 2 |    8   |
 * +----------------------------------+
 * <p/>
 * Array2 = offsetTable =
 * +---------------------------+
 * | Part of the pattern | gap |
 * +---------------------------+
 * |        NOT(A)N      |  8  |
 * +---------------------------+
 * |       NOT(M)AN      |  3  |
 * +---------------------------+
 * |       NOT(N)MAN     |  6  |
 * +---------------------------+
 * |       NOT(A)NMAN    |  6  |
 * +---------------------------+
 * |      NOT(P)ANMAN    |  6  |
 * +---------------------------+
 * |     NOT(N)PANMAN    |  6  |
 * +---------------------------+
 * |     NOT(A)NPANMAN   |  6  |
 * +---------------------------+
 * <p/>
 * With these two arrays, we are able to the Boyer-Moore Algorithm.
